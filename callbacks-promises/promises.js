 *  Promises solve the problem of Inversion of Control (IoC)
 *
 *  In JavaScript, Promises are special type of Objects that get
 *  returned immediately when we call them
 *
 *  Promises acts as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back
 *  sometime in future
 *
 *  In these Promise objects, we can attach the functionality we want to execute
 *  once the future task is done.
 *
 *  Once the future task is done, Promises will automatically execute the
 *  attached functionality.
