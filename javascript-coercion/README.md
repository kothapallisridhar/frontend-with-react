# Abstract Operations

1. These are some set of algorithms, that are present in the ecmascript docs, but they are not available for usage in ecmascript.

   - i.e. we as developers can not use these operations directly.

2. They are mentioned in the docs to aid(help) the documentation only.
   - In the ecma docs there are lot of things that are done by the language internally. To explain these internal details of how and what the language is doing, we have abstract operations mentioned in the documents.
