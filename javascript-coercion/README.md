# Abstract Operations

1. These are some set of algorithms, that are present in the ecmascript docs, but they are not available for usage in ecmascript.

   - i.e. we as developers can not use these operations directly.

2. They are mentioned in the docs to aid(help) the documentation only.
   - In the ecma docs there are lot of things that are done by the language internally. To explain these internal details of how and what the language is doing, we have abstract operations mentioned in the documents.

# Coercion

- type conversion
- Whenever we do an operation based on input we actually convert the input for operation.
- we can convert type of input.
- (expliit type conversion) this conversion can be manually done by us. (OR)
- (implicit type conversion. also know as Coercoin) the language based on some certain rules automatically converts the types.
